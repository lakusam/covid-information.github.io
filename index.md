## COVID Situation 2021-2022 / Data.Desi

COVID has spread all over the world. Many countries have imposed severe restrictions on their citizens. Some time ago, a website was created for people from different countries so that people can share about the COVID situation in their country. It is very important that people share information with each other. This is a good way to learn the truth from the locals. Tell us how things are going in your city.

1) Register on https://data.desi
2) Find your city through the search (if your city is not on the list, please write about it on the site)
3) Write a review about the situation in your city

Please tell your friends about the website and ask them to write reviews too. Search engines are crammed with sub-state news sites and it is difficult to "raise" a new site to google, so your help will be very great, especially now.

If you want to somehow help with this project, please write on the forum.

I hope 2022 will be better.

Thanks.
